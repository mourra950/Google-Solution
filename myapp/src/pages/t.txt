Welcome to MDLog a simple website with a noble and simple idea that hopefully will save lives.
Who are we?
We are a team of 4 from Egypt, Cairo.
Problem :
We have noticed 4 problems over the world which can make you think why not solve them:
1-In Egypt and also a lot of countries the absence of a health care system where accessing the previous medical history of any patient does raise challenges every day when taking medical decisions especially 
emergent ones where the second could mean life or death.
2-If you are traveling alone there is no way for a hospital where you travel to get a detailed history 
3-Non-doctors sometimes forget or categorize some of their actions or their history to be irrelevant to their current situations and ignore mentioning it to their doctors
which could lead to catastrophic results
4-Some time knowing early the current medical history could lead the hospitals to prepare the needed equipment or blood supply to save time and to save that one life.
Solution:
